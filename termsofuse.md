I am not being paid to create, host, or provide these materials. You may not resell or publicly re-share these materials
in any capacity, but you are free to ***USE THEM*** for your individual project(s).

I ask that you do not remove
attributions or links to this site from any documents, but this is not a strict requirement for use.
This helps foster a single, happy community around the projects that can share ideas together.

Examples of "okay" or "not okay" vibes:

- Okay - Sparks joy for me:
    - Showing a work breakdown in a YouTube video with a link to this website in the description and on the screen.
    - Printing out a work breakdown document and presenting it filled out with your project.
    - Duplicating a work breakdown document sheet, modifying the rows and using it for something different from what the original project was for.
    - Educators sharing a copy of a work breakdown document with their class on canvas, their site, etc.
- Not Okay - Will make me cry a little bit:
    - Showing a work breakdown in a YouTube video with no links, asking viewers to screenshot the video for the template.
    - Uploading these templates to a website making students watch advertisements to make some money off each download.
    - Creating torrents -- if there is a legitimate reason for torrents to exist of these documents, reach out and I will determine whether creating an official set of torrents is appropriate.
    - Copying templates on GitHub as a new repo
    - Forking this repo is okay, so long as the "link" to this repo remains.
