Welcome to my website! Here I will post software and electronics projects tutorials and materials.

My goal is to set up the passionate and capable student for success.
I try to link to resources when possible, but "giving the answers" is a **non-goal** for me.
This is especially true for programming -- the ideal reader for this website seeks the growth and validation from solving the challenge on their own.
These project management materials and selected guides help understand the scope and approach to a problem, but I am committing to myself to never provide the full answer.

In short, I hope this website reads as an escape room more than a recipe book.
